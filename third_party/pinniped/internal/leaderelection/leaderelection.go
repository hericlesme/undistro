// This middleware will prevent all non-read requests to the Kubernetes API when
// the current process does not hold the leader election lock.  Unlike normal
// leader election where the process blocks until it acquires the lock, this
// middleware approach lets the process run as normal for all read requests.
// Another difference is that if the process acquires the lock and then loses it
// (i.e. a failed renewal), it will not exit (i.e. restart).  Instead, it will
// simply attempt to acquire the lock again.
//
// The returned function is blocking and will run the leader election polling
// logic and will coordinate lease release with the input controller starter function.

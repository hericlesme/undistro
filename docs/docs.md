# 2 - Introduction

# UnDistro

## What is UnDistro (will be in version 1.0.0)?

UnDistro is an enterprise software that automates multicloud, on-prem, and edge operations with a single management UI.

UnDistro automates thousands of Kubernetes clusters across multi-cloud, on-prem and edge with unparalleled resilience. Deploy, manage and run multiple Kubernetes clusters with our platform. On your preferred infrastructure.

UnDistro Kubernetes Platform is directly integrated with leading cloud providers, and runs even in your own datacenter.

By providing managed Kubernetes clusters for your infrastructure, UnDistro makes Kubernetes as easy as it can be. UnDistro empowers you to take advantage of all the advanced features that Kubernetes has to offer and increases the speed, flexibility and scalability of your deployment workflow.

UnDistro provides live updates of your Kubernetes cluster without disrupting your daily business.

# 3 - Installing UnDistro

UnDistro requires an existing Kubernetes cluster accessible via kubectl. During the installation process
the Kubernetes cluster will be transformed into a [management cluster](./docs#Management-Cluster) by installing the UnDistro [provider components](./docs#Provider-Components), so it
is recommended to keep it separated from any application workload.

It is a common practice to create a temporary, local bootstrap cluster which is then used to provision
a target [management cluster](./docs#management-cluster) on the selected [infrastructure provider](./docs#infrastructure-provider).

After [prepare the environment](./docs#prepare-environment) choose one of the options below:

- [**Existing Cluster**](./docs#existing-cluster)
- [**Kind**](./docs#kind)

## Prepare environment

- Install and setup [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) in your local environment
- Install and setup [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) **(required just for kind installation method)**

## Existing Cluster

For production use-cases a "real" Kubernetes cluster should be used with appropriate backup and DR policies and procedures in place.

~~~bash
export KUBECONFIG=<...>
~~~

## Kind

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) is not designed for production use.

**Minimum [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) supported version**: v0.9.0

Can be used for creating a local Kubernetes cluster for development environments or for the creation of local bootstrap cluster which is then used to provision
a target
 [management cluster](./docs#Management-Cluster) on the selected [infrastructure provider](./docs#Infrastructure-Provider).

## Download UnDistro CLI

The UnDistro CLI tool handles the lifecycle of an UnDistro management cluster.

Download the latest version from the releases page: https://github.com/getupio-undistro/undistro/releases.

## Create the configuration file

The configuration changes according to provider we want to install. Know more in [configuration page](./docs#configuration)

## Initialize the management cluster

Now that we have got UnDistro CLI installed and all the prerequisites are in place, let's transform the Kubernetes cluster
into a management cluster by using **undistro install**.

~~~bash
undistro --config undistro-config.yaml install   
~~~

## Upgrade a provider into management cluster

~~~bash
undistro upgrade <provider name>
~~~

# 4 - Configuration

Configuration file is used by UnDistro just in the install and move operations.

# 5 - Providers 

# AWS

## Configure

To configure AWS just add credentials in UnDistro configuration file and run install command

**Configuration file**

replace **<key>** to your keys

~~~yaml
providers:
  -
    name: aws
    configuration:
      accessKeyID: <key>
      secretAccessKey: <key>
      sessionToken: <key> # if you use 2FA
      region: <key> # default region us-east-1
~~~

**Install command**

~~~bash
undistro --config undistro-config.yaml install
~~~

## Flavors supported

- ec2 (vanilla Kubernetes using AWS EC2 VMs)
- eks (AWS Kubernetes offer)

## Connecting to the nodes via SSH

To access one of the nodes (either a control plane node, or a worker node) via the SSH bastion host, use this command if you are using a non-EKS cluster:

~~~bash
ssh -i ${CLUSTER_SSH_KEY} ubuntu@<NODE_IP> -o "ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p -i ${CLUSTER_SSH_KEY} ubuntu@${BASTION_HOST}"
~~~

And use this command if you are using a EKS based cluster:

~~~bash
ssh -i ${CLUSTER_SSH_KEY} ec2-user@<NODE_IP> -o "ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p -i ${CLUSTER_SSH_KEY} ubuntu@${BASTION_HOST}"
~~~

Alternately, users can add a configuration stanza to their SSH configuration file (typically found on macOS/Linux systems as $HOME/.ssh/config):

~~~bash
Host 10.0.*
User ubuntu # for eks based cluster use ec2-user
IdentityFile <CLUSTER_SSH_KEY>
ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p ubuntu@<BASTION_HOST>
~~~

## Consuming existing AWS infrastructure

UnDistro Cluster lifecycle functionality is provided by [Cluster API project](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

Normally, Cluster API will create infrastructure on AWS when standing up a new workload cluster. However, it is possible to have Cluster API re-use existing AWS infrastructure instead of creating its own infrastructure. Follow the instructions below to configure Cluster API to consume existing AWS infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

In order to have Cluster API consume existing AWS infrastructure, you will need to have already created the following resources:

- A VPC
- One or more private subnets (subnets that do not have a route to an Internet gateway)
- A public subnet in the same Availability Zone (AZ) for each private subnet (this is required for NAT gateways to function properly)
- A NAT gateway for each private subnet, along with associated Elastic IP addresses
- An Internet gateway for all public subnets
- Route table associations that provide connectivity to the Internet through a NAT gateway (for private subnets), or the Internet gateway (for public subnets)

Note that a public subnet (and associated Internet gateway) are required even if the control plane of the workload cluster is set to use an internal load balancer.

You will need the ID of the VPC and subnet IDs that Cluster API should use. This information is available via the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

Note that there is no need to create an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), security groups, or EC2 instances; Cluster API will take care of these items.

### Tagging AWS Resources

Cluster API itself does tag AWS resources it creates. The **sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws/cluster/<cluster-name>** (where *<cluster-name>* matches the *metadata.name* field of the Cluster object) tag, with a value of **owned**, tells Cluster API that it has ownership of the resource. In this case, Cluster API will modify and manage the lifecycle of the resource.

When consuming existing AWS infrastructure, the Cluster API AWS provider does not require any tags to be present. The absence of the tags on an AWS resource indicates to Cluster API that it should not modify the resource or attempt to manage the lifecycle of the resource.

However, the built-in Kubernetes AWS cloud provider doesn’t  require certain tags in order to function properly. Specifically, all subnets where Kubernetes nodes 
reside should have the **kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name>** tag present. Private subnets should also have the **kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb** tag with a value of **1**, and public subnets should have the **kubernetes.io/role/elb** tag with a value of **1**. These latter two tags help the cloud provider understand which subnets to use when creating load balancers.

# 8 - Architecture

The overarching architecture of UnDistro is centered around a "management plane". This plane is expected to serve as a single interface upon which administrators can create, scale, upgrade, and delete Kubernetes clusters. At a high level view, the management plane + created clusters should look something like this:
